# Low Issues

## L-1: Centralization Risk for trusted owners

Contracts have owners with privileged rights to perform admin tasks and need to be trusted to not perform malicious updates or drain funds.

<details><summary>0 Found Instances</summary>


</details>



## L-2: Missing checks for `address(0)` when assigning values to address state variables

Check for `address(0)` when assigning values to address state variables.

<details><summary>1 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/strategies/AaveStrategyVault.sol [Line: 75](src/strategies/AaveStrategyVault.sol#L75)

	```solidity
	        aToken = IAToken(pool_.getReserveData(address(asset_)).aTokenAddress);
	```

</details>



## L-3: `public` functions not used internally could be marked `external`

Instead of marking a function as `public`, consider marking it as `external` if it is not used internally.

<details><summary>0 Found Instances</summary>


</details>



## L-4: Event is missing `indexed` fields

Index event fields make the field more quickly accessible to off-chain tools that parse events. However, note that each index field costs extra gas during emission, so it's not necessarily best to index the maximum allowed per event (three fields). Each event should use three indexed fields if there are three or more fields, and gas usage is not particularly of concern for the events in question. If there are fewer than three fields, all of the fields should be indexed.

## L-5: The `nonReentrant` `modifier` should occur before all other modifiers

This is a best-practice to protect against reentrancy in other modifiers.

<details><summary>0 Found Instances</summary>


</details>



## L-6: Empty Block

Consider removing empty blocks.

<details><summary>0 Found Instances</summary>


</details>



## L-7: Unused Custom Error

it is recommended that the definition be removed when custom error is unused

<details><summary>1 Found Instances</summary>
